## Inroduction
- This programming problem is to simulate the bitcoin mining of computing hash values with some specific form. Note that this is not the real bitcoin mining. It only verifies the difficulty of finding hash values with many leading zeros. Use Crypto++ for computing sha256.

## Reproducing results
